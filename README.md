About
-----
Import and keep your Youtube subscriptions in Newsboat up-to-date with ease.
The script uses Youtube API to request your subscriptions based on the given
channel id and adds them to your Newsboat 'urls' file if they are not there yet.
It sets a '#Automated' tag next to the entries generated by this script, and
this is used when deleting expired subscriptions.

Improvements
------------
Newsboat itself has an import function which does serve a basic purpose of
importing the OPML file exported from Youtube subscription manager and adds
them to your 'urls' file. The way this script improves on top of this, is that 
it allows you to easily add and delete subscriptions without having to manually 
export them from the Youtube's website.

Usage
-----
+ Download the script for example by running `git clone https://github.com/Jertzukka/youtube-to-rss.sh`
+ Get your Channel ID by navigating Youtube to Settings and Advanced Settings. 
Open the script in an editor, and replace the existing 'channelid=' with your own, 
and save the file.
+ If necessary, make the file executable by running `chmod +x ./youtube-to-rss.sh`
+ Run the script with `./youtube-to-rss.sh`

Dependencies
------------
+ **bash**
+ **jq**, lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.
